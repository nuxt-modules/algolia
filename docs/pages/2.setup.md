Check out the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/docs/directory-structure/nuxt.config#buildmodules) for more information about installing and using modules.

## Installation

> **WARNING:** This package was recently moved to nuxt-community so it's name have changed from `@nuxt-modules/algolia` to `@nuxtjs/algolia`. There was no other changes than the name of the package.

Add `@nuxtjs/algolia` dependency to your project:

<code-group>
  <code-block label="Yarn" active>

```bash
yarn add @nuxtjs/algolia
```

  </code-block>
  <code-block label="NPM">

```bash
npm install @nuxtjs/algolia
```

  </code-block>
</code-group>

Then, add `@nuxtjs/algolia` to the [`buildModules`](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/docs/directory-structure/nuxt.config#buildmodules) section of your Nuxt configuration:

```ts [nuxt.config.js|ts]
export default {
  buildModules: [
    [
      "@nuxtjs/algolia",
      {
        // Options
      },
    ],
  ],
  // Or
  algolia: {
    // Options
  },
};
```

## Options

Defaults:

```ts
{
  apiKey: '<YOUR_SEARCH_API_KEY>',
  applicationId: '<YOUR_APPLICATION_ID>',
  lite: true,
  instantSearch: true,
  crawler: {
    apiKey: '<YOUR_API_KEY>',
    indexName: '<YOUR_INDEX_NAME>',
    meta: ['title', 'description']
    include: () => true
  }
}
```

### `apiKey`

This is the public API key to use in your frontend code. This key is only usable for search queries and sending data to the Insights API.

> You can read more about it [here](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/security/api-keys/)

### `applicationId`

This is your unique application identifier. It's used to identify you when using Algolia's API.

> You can get it [here](https://www.algolia.com/account/api-keys/)

### `lite`

By default set to true. Indicates whether to use 'algoliasearch-lite' or normal 'algoliasearch' package. Depending on your needs, if you only need to search you can set this option to true or do not set any option (it is by default true). But if you need more advances functionalities like multi queries, indexing, etc, you can set it to false to load full algoliasearch client.

> You can get it [here](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-client/getting-started/update-the-client/javascript/?client=javascript#search-onlylite-client)

### `instantSearch`

By default set to true. Indicates whether to install the official [vue-instantsearch](https://github.com/algolia/vue-instantsearch) plugin.

> More information available in the official [Algolia docs](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/what-is-instantsearch/vue/).

### `crawler`

> Nuxt 3 SSG is currently under development (see [Comparison](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/getting-started/introduction#comparison))

Indicates whether you would like the module to automatically index your pages when using Nuxt static site generation. Both the `apiKey` and the `indexName` need to be set for this feature to be enabled.

#### `crawler.apiKey`

By default this option is not set. This is your private API key to use in your backend code. This key is used to update your Algolia index. _DO NOT USE YOUR ADMIN KEY!_ Instead use your admin key to generate another _limited_ key with at least the `addObject` and `deleteObject` rights.

> You can read more about it [here](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/security/api-keys/)

#### `crawler.indexName`

By default this option is not set. This is the name of your Algolia index that will store all your pages' metadata.

> You can check out how to create a new index [here](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/send-and-update-your-data/how-to/importing-from-the-dashboard/#creating-a-new-index)

#### `crawler.meta`

By default this option is set to `['title', 'description']`. This is the list of metafields that you would like to store when indexing a page. It can either be an array of fields or a function that returns an object of fields. The function should return a string and can be asynchronous.

<code-group>
  <code-block label="Array" active>

```ts
{
  ...
  meta: ['title', 'description', 'lang']
}
```

  </code-block>
  <code-block label="Function">

```ts
{
  ...
  meta: async (html: string, route: string) => {
    const result = await somePromise(route)

    return {
      ...result,
      foo: 'bar'
    }
  }
}
```

  </code-block>
</code-group>

#### `crawler.include`

By default this option is not set. This option is used to filter the pages that you would like to index by their route. It can either be an array of strings and/or regular expressions, or a function that should return a boolean. If the option is undefined, then all pages are indexed (default).

<code-group>
  <code-block label="Array" active>

```ts
{
  ...
  include: ['/foo', /^(?!\/?admin).+/]
}
```

  </code-block>
  <code-block label="Function">

```ts
{
  ...
  include: (route: string) => {
    return !route.startsWith('admin')
  }
}
```

  </code-block>
</code-group>
