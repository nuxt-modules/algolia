## Crawler

> This section only applies if you are using Nuxt static site generation.
> Nuxt 3 SSG is currently under development (see [Comparison](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/getting-started/introduction#comparison))

When setting the `crawler` option of this module (see [Setup](/setup#crawler)), the module will automatically collect your pages' metadata and store them in an Algolia index. This allows you to easily add a search functionality on your website or blog without worrying about updating your indices as the process happens during the Nuxt static generation. This feature works with both Nuxt 2 and Bridge, and will support Nuxt 3 as soon as SSG is fully implemented.

## Using with Vue-Instantsearch components

By default, Algolia module only provides the search functionality but you can enable the vue-instantsearch components support to have Vue 3 components ready to serve as search and result components.

In order to enable them, first add `instantSearch` configuration option to module configuration:

```ts
import { defineNuxtConfig } from 'nuxt3'

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  buildModules: [
    '@nuxtjs/algolia',
  ],
  algolia: {
    apiKey: process.env.ALGOLIA_SEARCH_API_KEY,
    applicationId: process.env.ALGOLIA_APPLICATION_ID,
    instantSearch: {
      theme: 'algolia'
    }
  }
})
```

*You can choose a theme from `satelite`, `reset`, and `algolia`. Check out setup docs [here]('/setup#instantSearch.theme')*

Next, let's create `indexName` variable and call `useAlgolia` composable in page.vue script section to get the reference to Algolia:

```ts
<script lang="ts" setup>
const indexName = 'test_index'
const algolia = useAlgolia()
</script>
```

Finally, let's use it in our page.vue template section with vue-instantsearch components:

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <ais-instant-search :index-name="indexName" :search-client="algolia">
      <ais-search-box />
      <ais-hits />
    </ais-instant-search>
  </div>
</template>
```
